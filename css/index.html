        <p id="para1">In 1902, an Austrian automobile entrepreneur, Emil Jellinek, trademarked the name “Mercedes” after his daughter, Mercedes Jellinek. Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler later combined their companies in 1926, and thus began the production of the first brand-name Mercedes-Benz models. Mercedes-Benz is a German automobile manufacturer that is headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany. The brand is known for its precision engineering and attention to detail, which is a hallmark of German manufacturing.</p><br>
        <p id="para2">Later in 1886, Gottlieb Daimler, Wilheim Maybach, and Benz decided to convert a stagecoach with a fully-functional petrol engine. It became available on the market in 1901 as an official part of the Daimler Motors Corporation. This success got the attention of Austrian entrepreneur Emil Jellinek, who worked with the group in 1902 to create the 1901 Mercedes (named after Jellinek's daughter). After enjoying immense popularity across the world, Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler merged companies to engineer the first vehicles to ever carry the Mercedes-Benz brand in 1926. From that point on, Mercedes-Benz has been known for bringing revolutionary ideas to the automotive world.</p>
